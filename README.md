Add numbers in the tiles to get number displayed on the right! This is my experiment of making an Android game with Javascript.

You can also enjoy this game on your android phone. Download APK file here - https://github.com/ansal/tilesum/raw/master/assets/TileSum_2014_08_01-12_16_33_GooglePlaystoreV3_debug_signed.apk

JS to APK compilation is done using the wonderful CoccoonJS compiler - https://www.ludei.com/cocoonjs/
